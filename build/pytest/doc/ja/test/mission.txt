Mission
====================================

py.test strives to make testing a fun and no-boilerplate effort.

The tool is distributed as part of the `py` package which contains supporting APIs that
are also usable independently.  The project independent ``py.test`` command line tool helps you to:

* rapidly collect and run tests
* run unit- or doctests, functional or integration tests
* distribute tests to multiple environments
* use local or global plugins for custom test types and setup
