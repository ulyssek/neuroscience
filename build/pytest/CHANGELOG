Changes between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5dev
-----------------------------------

- never consider a fixture function for test function collection

- allow re-running of test items / helps to fix pytest-reruntests plugin
  and also help to keep less fixture/resource references alive

- put captured stdout/stderr into junitxml output even for passing tests
  (thanks Adam Goucher)

- Issue 265 - integrate nose setup/teardown with setupstate
  so it doesnt try to teardown if it did not setup

- issue 271 - dont write junitxml on slave nodes

- Issue 274 - dont try to show full doctest example
  when doctest does not know the example location

- issue 280 - disable assertion rewriting on buggy CPython 2.6.0

- inject "getfixture()" helper to retrieve fixtures from doctests,
  thanks Andreas Zeidler

- issue 259 - when assertion rewriting, be consistent with the default
  source encoding of ASCII on Python 2

- issue 251 - report a skip instead of ignoring classes with init

- issue250 unicode/str mixes in parametrization names and values now works

- issue257, assertion-triggered compilation of source ending in a
  comment line doesn't blow up in python2.5 (fixed through py>=1.4.13.dev6)

- fix --genscript option to generate standalone scripts that also
  work with python3.3 (importer ordering)

- issue171 - in assertion rewriting, show the repr of some
  global variables

- fix option help for "-k"

- move long description of distribution into README.rst

- improve docstring for metafunc.parametrize()

- fix bug where using capsys with pytest.set_trace() in a test
  function would break when looking at capsys.readouterr()

- allow to specify prefixes starting with "_" when 
  customizing python_functions test discovery. (thanks Graham Horler)

- improve PYTEST_DEBUG tracing output by puting
  extra data on a new lines with additional indent

- ensure OutcomeExceptions like skip/fail have initialized exception attributes

- issue 260 - don't use nose special setup on plain unittest cases

- fix issue134 - print the collect errors that prevent running specified test items

- fix issue266 - accept unicode in MarkEvaluator expressions

Changes between 2.3.3 and 2.3.4
-----------------------------------

- yielded test functions will now have autouse-fixtures active but 
  cannot accept fixtures as funcargs - it's anyway recommended to
  rather use the post-2.0 parametrize features instead of yield, see:
  http://pytest.org/latest/example/parametrize.html
- fix autouse-issue where autouse-fixtures would not be discovered
  if defined in a a/conftest.py file and tests in a/tests/test_some.py
- fix issue226 - LIFO ordering for fixture teardowns
- fix issue224 - invocations with >256 char arguments now work
- fix issue91 - add/discuss package/directory level setups in example
- allow to dynamically define markers via
  item.keywords[...]=assignment integrating with "-m" option
- make "-k" accept an expressions the same as with "-m" so that one
  can write: -k "name1 or name2" etc.  This is a slight incompatibility
  if you used special syntax like "TestClass.test_method" which you now
  need to write as -k "TestClass and test_method" to match a certain
  method in a certain test class.  

Changes between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3
-----------------------------------

- fix issue214 - parse modules that contain special objects like e. g.
  flask's request object which blows up on getattr access if no request
  is active. thanks Thomas Waldmann.

- fix issue213 - allow to parametrize with values like numpy arrays that
  do not support an __eq__ operator

- fix issue215 - split test_python.org into multiple files

- fix issue148 - @unittest.skip on classes is now recognized and avoids
  calling setUpClass/tearDownClass, thanks Pavel Repin

  pylib which re-introduced statement-finding for pre-AST interpreters

- nose support: only call setup if its a callable, thanks Andrew
  Taumoefolau

- fix issue219 - add py2.4-3.3 classifiers to TROVE list

- in tracebacks *,** arg values are now shown next to normal arguments
  (thanks Manuel Jacob)

- fix issue217 - support mock.patch with pytest's fixtures - note that
  you need either mock-1.0.1 or the python3.3 builtin unittest.mock.

- fix issue127 - improve documentation for pytest_addoption() and
  add a ``config.getoption(name)`` helper function for consistency.

Changes between 2.3.1 and 2.3.2
-----------------------------------

- fix issue208 and fix issue29 use new py version to avoid long pauses 
  when printing tracebacks in long modules

- fix issue205 - conftests in subdirs customizing
  pytest_pycollect_makemodule and pytest_pycollect_makeitem
  now work properly

- fix teardown-ordering for parametrized setups

- fix issue127 - better documentation for pytest_addoption
  and related objects.

- fix unittest behaviour: TestCase.runtest only called if there are
  test methods defined

- improve trial support: don't collect its empty
  unittest.TestCase.runTest() method

- "python setup.py test" now works with pytest itself

- fix/improve internal/packaging related bits:

  - exception message check of test_nose.py now passes on python33 as well

  - issue206 - fix test_assertrewrite.py to work when a global
    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 is present

  - add tox.ini to pytest distribution so that ignore-dirs and others config
    bits are properly distributed for maintainers who run pytest-own tests

Changes between 2.3.0 and 2.3.1
-----------------------------------

- fix issue202 - fix regression: using "self" from fixture functions now
  works as expected (it's the same "self" instance that a test method
  which uses the fixture sees)

- skip pexpect using tests (test_pdb.py mostly) on freebsd* systems
  due to pexpect not supporting it properly (hanging)

- link to web pages from --markers output which provides help for
  pytest.mark.* usage.

Changes between 2.2.4 and 2.3.0
-----------------------------------

- fix issue202 - better automatic names for parametrized test functions
- fix issue139 - introduce @pytest.fixture which allows direct scoping
  and parametrization of funcarg factories.
- fix issue198 - conftest fixtures were not found on windows32 in some
  circumstances with nested directory structures due to path manipulation issues
- fix issue193 skip test functions with were parametrized with empty
  parameter sets
- fix python3.3 compat, mostly reporting bits that previously depended
  on dict ordering

- fix issue185 monkeypatching time.time does not cause pytest to fail
- fix issue172 duplicate call of pytest.fixture decoratored setup_module
  functions

  current working directory and the path is a relative path
  it is constructed correctly from the original current working dir.
- fix "python setup.py test" example to cause a proper "errno" return
- fix issue165 - fix broken doc links and mention stackoverflow for FAQ
- catch unicode-issues when writing failure representations
  to terminal to prevent the whole session from crashing
- fix xfail/skip confusion: a skip-mark or an imperative pytest.skip
  will now take precedence before xfail-markers because we
  can't determine xfail/xpass status in case of a skip. see also:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11105828/in-py-test-when-i-explicitly-skip-a-test-that-is-marked-as-xfail-how-can-i-get

- always report installed 3rd party plugins in the header of a test run

- fix issue160: a failing setup of an xfail-marked tests should
  be reported as xfail (not xpass)

- fix issue128: show captured output when capsys/capfd are used

- fix issue179: propperly show the dependency chain of factories

- pluginmanager.register(...) now raises ValueError if the
  plugin has been already registered or the name is taken

- fix issue159: improve http://pytest.org/latest/faq.html 
  especially with respect to the "magic" history, also mention
  pytest-django, trial and unittest integration.

- make request.keywords and node.keywords writable.  All descendant
  collection nodes will see keyword values.  Keywords are dictionaries
  containing markers and other info.

- fix issue 178: xml binary escapes are now wrapped in py.xml.raw

- fix issue 176: correctly catch the builtin AssertionError
  even when we replaced AssertionError with a subclass on the
  python level

- factory discovery no longer fails with magic global callables
  that provide no sane __code__ object (mock.call for example)

                 before calling into a test

- fix issue 191: add unittest TestCase runTest method support
- fix issue 156: monkeypatch correctly handles class level descriptors

- reporting refinements:

  - pytest_report_header now receives a "startdir" so that
    you can use startdir.bestrelpath(yourpath) to show
    nice relative path

  - allow plugins to implement both pytest_report_header and 
    pytest_sessionstart (sessionstart is invoked first).

  - don't show deselected reason line if there is none

  - py.test -vv will show all of assert comparisations instead of truncating

Changes between 2.2.3 and 2.2.4
-----------------------------------

- fix error message for rewritten assertions involving the % operator
- fix issue 126: correctly match all invalid xml characters for junitxml
  binary escape
- fix issue with unittest: now @unittest.expectedFailure markers should
  be processed correctly (you can also use @pytest.mark markers)
- document integration with the extended distribute/setuptools test commands
- fix issue 140: propperly get the real functions
  of bound classmethods for setup/teardown_class
- fix issue #141: switch from the deceased paste.pocoo.org to bpaste.net
- fix issue #143: call unconfigure/sessionfinish always when
  configure/sessionstart where called
- fix issue #144: better mangle test ids to junitxml classnames
- upgrade distribute_setup.py to 0.6.27

Changes between 2.2.2 and 2.2.3
----------------------------------------

- fix uploaded package to only include neccesary files

Changes between 2.2.1 and 2.2.2
----------------------------------------

- fix issue101: wrong args to unittest.TestCase test function now
  produce better output
- fix issue102: report more useful errors and hints for when a 
  test directory was renamed and some pyc/__pycache__ remain
- fix issue106: allow parametrize to be applied multiple times
  e.g. from module, class and at function level.
- fix issue107: actually perform session scope finalization
- don't check in parametrize if indirect parameters are funcarg names
- add chdir method to monkeypatch funcarg
- fix crash resulting from calling monkeypatch undo a second time
- fix issue115: make --collectonly robust against early failure
  (missing files/directories)
- "-qq --collectonly" now shows only files and the number of tests in them
- "-q --collectonly" now shows test ids
- allow adding of attributes to test reports such that it also works
  with distributed testing (no upgrade of pytest-xdist needed)

Changes between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1
----------------------------------------

- fix issue99 (in pytest and py) internallerrors with resultlog now
  produce better output - fixed by normalizing pytest_internalerror 
  input arguments.
- fix issue97 / traceback issues (in pytest and py) improve traceback output
  in conjunction with jinja2 and cython which hack tracebacks
- fix issue93 (in pytest and pytest-xdist) avoid "delayed teardowns":
  the final test in a test node will now run its teardown directly
  instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for
  the good reporting and feedback.  The pytest_runtest_protocol as well
  as the pytest_runtest_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available 
  which will be None indicating the end of the test run.
- fix collection crash due to unknown-source collected items, thanks
  to Ralf Schmitt (fixed by depending on a more recent pylib)

Changes between 2.1.3 and 2.2.0
----------------------------------------

- fix issue90: introduce eager tearing down of test items so that
  teardown function are called earlier.
- add an all-powerful metafunc.parametrize function which allows to 
  parametrize test function arguments in multiple steps and therefore
  from indepdenent plugins and palces. 
- add a @pytest.mark.parametrize helper which allows to easily
  call a test function with different argument values
- Add examples to the "parametrize" example page, including a quick port 
  of Test scenarios and the new parametrize function and decorator.
- introduce registration for "pytest.mark.*" helpers via ini-files
  or through plugin hooks.  Also introduce a "--strict" option which 
  will treat unregistered markers as errors
  allowing to avoid typos and maintain a well described set of markers
  for your test suite.  See exaples at http://pytest.org/latest/mark.html
  and its links.
- issue50: introduce "-m marker" option to select tests based on markers
  (this is a stricter and more predictable version of '-k' in that "-m"
  only matches complete markers and has more obvious rules for and/or
  semantics.
- new feature to help optimizing the speed of your tests: 
  --durations=N option for displaying N slowest test calls 
  and setup/teardown methods.
- fix issue87: --pastebin now works with python3
- fix issue89: --pdb with unexpected exceptions in doctest work more sensibly
- fix and cleanup pytest's own test suite to not leak FDs 
- fix issue83: link to generated funcarg list
- fix issue74: pyarg module names are now checked against imp.find_module false positives
- fix compatibility with twisted/trial-11.1.0 use cases
- simplify Node.listchain
- simplify junitxml output code by relying on py.xml
- add support for skip properties on unittest classes and functions

Changes between 2.1.2 and 2.1.3
----------------------------------------

- fix issue79: assertion rewriting failed on some comparisons in boolops
- correctly handle zero length arguments (a la pytest '')
- fix issue67 / junitxml now contains correct test durations, thanks ronny
- fix issue75 / skipping test failure on jython
- fix issue77 / Allow assertrepr_compare hook to apply to a subset of tests

Changes between 2.1.1 and 2.1.2
----------------------------------------

- fix assertion rewriting on files with windows newlines on some Python versions
- refine test discovery by package/module name (--pyargs), thanks Florian Mayer
- fix issue69 / assertion rewriting fixed on some boolean operations
- fix issue68 / packages now work with assertion rewriting
- fix issue66: use different assertion rewriting caches when the -O option is passed
- don't try assertion rewriting on Jython, use reinterp

Changes between 2.1.0 and 2.1.1
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue64 / pytest.set_trace now works within pytest_generate_tests hooks
- fix issue60 / fix error conditions involving the creation of __pycache__
- fix issue63 / assertion rewriting on inserts involving strings containing '%'
- fix assertion rewriting on calls with a ** arg
- don't cache rewritten modules if bytecode generation is disabled
- fix assertion rewriting in read-only directories
- fix issue59: provide system-out/err tags for junitxml output
- fix issue61: assertion rewriting on boolean operations with 3 or more operands
- you can now build a man page with "cd doc ; make man"

Changes between 2.0.3 and 2.1.0.DEV
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue53 call nosestyle setup functions with correct ordering
- fix issue58 and issue59: new assertion code fixes
- merge Benjamin's assertionrewrite branch: now assertions
  for test modules on python 2.6 and above are done by rewriting
  the AST and saving the pyc file before the test module is imported.
  see doc/assert.txt for more info.
- fix issue43: improve doctests with better traceback reporting on
  unexpected exceptions
- fix issue47: timing output in junitxml for test cases is now correct
- fix issue48: typo in MarkInfo repr leading to exception
- fix issue49: avoid confusing error when initizaliation partially fails
- fix issue44: env/username expansion for junitxml file path
- show releaselevel information in test runs for pypy
- reworked doc pages for better navigation and PDF generation
- report KeyboardInterrupt even if interrupted during session startup
- fix issue 35 - provide PDF doc version and download link from index page

Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue38: nicer tracebacks on calls to hooks, particularly early
  configure/sessionstart ones

- fix missing skip reason/meta information in junitxml files, reported
  via http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2011-March/003928.html

- fix issue34: avoid collection failure with "test" prefixed classes
  deriving from object.

- don't require zlib (and other libs) for genscript plugin without
  --genscript actually being used.

- speed up skips (by not doing a full traceback represenation
  internally)

- fix issue37: avoid invalid characters in junitxml's output

Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2
----------------------------------------------

- tackle issue32 - speed up test runs of very quick test functions
  by reducing the relative overhead

- fix issue30 - extended xfail/skipif handling and improved reporting.
  If you have a syntax error in your skip/xfail
  expressions you now get nice error reports.

  Also you can now access module globals from xfail/skipif
  expressions so that this for example works now::
 
    import pytest
    import mymodule
    @pytest.mark.skipif("mymodule.__version__[0] == "1")
    def test_function():
        pass

  This will not run the test function if the module's version string 
  does not start with a "1".  Note that specifying a string instead
  of a boolean expressions allows py.test to report meaningful information 
  when summarizing a test run as to what conditions lead to skipping 
  (or xfail-ing) tests.

- fix issue28 - setup_method and pytest_generate_tests work together
  The setup_method fixture method now gets called also for
  test function invocations generated from the pytest_generate_tests
  hook.

- fix issue27 - collectonly and keyword-selection (-k) now work together
  Also, if you do "py.test --collectonly -q" you now get a flat list
  of test ids that you can use to paste to the py.test commandline
  in order to execute a particular test.

- fix issue25 avoid reported problems with --pdb and python3.2/encodings output

- fix issue23 - tmpdir argument now works on Python3.2 and WindowsXP
  Starting with Python3.2 os.symlink may be supported. By requiring
  a newer py lib version the py.path.local() implementation acknowledges
  this.

- fixed typos in the docs (thanks Victor Garcia, Brianna Laugher) and particular
  thanks to Laura Creighton who also revieved parts of the documentation.

- fix slighly wrong output of verbose progress reporting for classes 
  (thanks Amaury)

- more precise (avoiding of) deprecation warnings for node.Class|Function accesses

- avoid std unittest assertion helper code in tracebacks (thanks Ronny)

Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1
----------------------------------------------

- refine and unify initial capturing so that it works nicely
  even if the logging module is used on an early-loaded conftest.py
  file or plugin.
- allow to omit "()" in test ids to allow for uniform test ids
  as produced by Alfredo's nice pytest.vim plugin.
- fix issue12 - show plugin versions with "--version" and
  "--traceconfig" and also document how to add extra information 
  to reporting test header
- fix issue17 (import-* reporting issue on python3) by
  requiring py>1.4.0 (1.4.1 is going to include it)
- fix issue10 (numpy arrays truth checking) by refining
  assertion interpretation in py lib
- fix issue15: make nose compatibility tests compatible
  with python3 (now that nose-1.0 supports python3)
- remove somewhat surprising "same-conftest" detection because
  it ignores conftest.py when they appear in several subdirs.
- improve assertions ("not in"), thanks Floris Bruynooghe
- improve behaviour/warnings when running on top of "python -OO"
  (assertions and docstrings are turned off, leading to potential
  false positives)
- introduce a pytest_cmdline_processargs(args) hook
  to allow dynamic computation of command line arguments.
  This fixes a regression because py.test prior to 2.0
  allowed to set command line options from conftest.py
  files which so far pytest-2.0 only allowed from ini-files now.
- fix issue7: assert failures in doctest modules.
  unexpected failures in doctests will not generally
  show nicer, i.e. within the doctest failing context.
- fix issue9: setup/teardown functions for an xfail-marked
  test will report as xfail if they fail but report as normally
  passing (not xpassing) if they succeed.  This only is true
  for "direct" setup/teardown invocations because teardown_class/
  teardown_module cannot closely relate to a single test.
- fix issue14: no logging errors at process exit
- refinements to "collecting" output on non-ttys
- refine internal plugin registration and --traceconfig output
- introduce a mechanism to prevent/unregister plugins from the 
  command line, see http://pytest.org/plugins.html#cmdunregister
- activate resultlog plugin by default
- fix regression wrt yielded tests which due to the
  collection-before-running semantics were not 
  setup as with pytest 1.3.4.  Note, however, that
  the recommended and much cleaner way to do test 
  parametraization remains the "pytest_generate_tests"
  mechanism, see the docs.

Changes between 1.3.4 and 2.0.0
----------------------------------------------

- pytest-2.0 is now its own package and depends on pylib-2.0
- new ability: python -m pytest / python -m pytest.main ability
- new python invcation: pytest.main(args, plugins) to load
  some custom plugins early.
- try harder to run unittest test suites in a more compatible manner
  by deferring setup/teardown semantics to the unittest package.
  also work harder to run twisted/trial and Django tests which
  should now basically work by default.
- introduce a new way to set config options via ini-style files,
  by default setup.cfg and tox.ini files are searched.  The old
  ways (certain environment variables, dynamic conftest.py reading
  is removed).
- add a new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more
  nose/unittest-style "dot" output.
- fix issue135 - marks now work with unittest test cases as well
- fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set_trace() to trace execution via
  PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
- fix issue123 - new "python -m py.test" invocation for py.test
  (requires Python 2.5 or above)
- fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening
  files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
- fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded.
  (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's
  conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
- introduce (customizable) assertion failure representations and enhance
  output on assertion failures for comparisons and other cases (Floris Bruynooghe)
- nose-plugin: pass through type-signature failures in setup/teardown
  functions instead of not calling them (Ed Singleton)
- remove py.test.collect.Directory (follows from a major refactoring
  and simplification of the collection process)
- majorly reduce py.test core code, shift function/python testing to own plugin
- fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
- refine 'tmpdir' creation, will now create basenames better associated
  with test names (thanks Ronny)
- "xpass" (unexpected pass) tests don't cause exitcode!=0
- fix issue131 / issue60 - importing doctests in __init__ files used as namespace packages
- fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
- fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark"
  applied at class/module level
- add ability to use "class" level for cached_setup helper
- fix strangeness: mark.* objects are now immutable, create new instances

Changes between 1.3.3 and 1.3.4
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue111: improve install documentation for windows
- fix issue119: fix custom collectability of __init__.py as a module
- fix issue116: --doctestmodules work with __init__.py files as well
- fix issue115: unify internal exception passthrough/catching/GeneratorExit
- fix issue118: new --tb=native for presenting cpython-standard exceptions

Changes between 1.3.2 and 1.3.3
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue113: assertion representation problem with triple-quoted strings
  (and possibly other cases)
- make conftest loading detect that a conftest file with the same
  content was already loaded, avoids surprises in nested directory structures
  which can be produced e.g. by Hudson. It probably removes the need to use
  --confcutdir in most cases.
- fix terminal coloring for win32
  (thanks Michael Foord for reporting)
- fix weirdness: make terminal width detection work on stdout instead of stdin
  (thanks Armin Ronacher for reporting)
- remove trailing whitespace in all py/text distribution files

Changes between 1.3.1 and 1.3.2
----------------------------------------------

New features
++++++++++++++++++

- fix issue103:  introduce py.test.raises as context manager, examples::

    with py.test.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        x = 0
        1 / x

    with py.test.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:
        call_something()

    # you may do extra checks on excinfo.value|type|traceback here

  (thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt)

- Funcarg factories can now dynamically apply a marker to a
  test invocation.  This is for example useful if a factory
  provides parameters to a test which are expected-to-fail::

    def pytest_funcarg__arg(request):
        request.applymarker(py.test.mark.xfail(reason="flaky config"))
        ...

    def test_function(arg):
        ...

- improved error reporting on collection and import errors. This makes
  use of a more general mechanism, namely that for custom test item/collect
  nodes ``node.repr_failure(excinfo)`` is now uniformly called so that you can
  override it to return a string error representation of your choice
  which is going to be reported as a (red) string.

- introduce '--junitprefix=STR' option to prepend a prefix
  to all reports in the junitxml file.

Bug fixes / Maintenance
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- make tests and the ``pytest_recwarn`` plugin in particular fully compatible
  to Python2.7 (if you use the ``recwarn`` funcarg warnings will be enabled so that
  you can properly check for their existence in a cross-python manner).
- refine --pdb: ignore xfailed tests, unify its TB-reporting and
  don't display failures again at the end.
- fix assertion interpretation with the ** operator (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix issue105 assignment on the same line as a failing assertion (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix issue104 proper escaping for test names in junitxml plugin (thanks anonymous)
- fix issue57 -f|--looponfail to work with xpassing tests (thanks Ronny)
- fix issue92 collectonly reporter and --pastebin (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix py.code.compile(source) to generate unique filenames
- fix assertion re-interp problems on PyPy, by defering code
  compilation to the (overridable) Frame.eval class. (thanks Amaury Forgeot)
- fix py.path.local.pyimport() to work with directories
- streamline py.path.local.mkdtemp implementation and usage
- don't print empty lines when showing junitxml-filename
- add optional boolean ignore_errors parameter to py.path.local.remove
- fix terminal writing on win32/python2.4
- py.process.cmdexec() now tries harder to return properly encoded unicode objects
  on all python versions
- install plain py.test/py.which scripts also for Jython, this helps to
  get canonical script paths in virtualenv situations
- make path.bestrelpath(path) return ".", note that when calling
  X.bestrelpath the assumption is that X is a directory.
- make initial conftest discovery ignore "--" prefixed arguments
- fix resultlog plugin when used in an multicpu/multihost xdist situation
  (thanks Jakub Gustak)
- perform distributed testing related reporting in the xdist-plugin
  rather than having dist-related code in the generic py.test
  distribution
- fix homedir detection on Windows
- ship distribute_setup.py version 0.6.13

Changes between 1.3.0 and 1.3.1
---------------------------------------------

New features
++++++++++++++++++

- issue91: introduce new py.test.xfail(reason) helper
  to imperatively mark a test as expected to fail. Can
  be used from within setup and test functions. This is
  useful especially for parametrized tests when certain
  configurations are expected-to-fail.  In this case the
  declarative approach with the @py.test.mark.xfail cannot
  be used as it would mark all configurations as xfail.

- issue102: introduce new --maxfail=NUM option to stop
  test runs after NUM failures.  This is a generalization
  of the '-x' or '--exitfirst' option which is now equivalent
  to '--maxfail=1'.  Both '-x' and '--maxfail' will
  now also print a line near the end indicating the Interruption.

- issue89: allow py.test.mark decorators to be used on classes
  (class decorators were introduced with python2.6) and
  also allow to have multiple markers applied at class/module level
  by specifying a list.

- improve and refine letter reporting in the progress bar:
  .  pass
  f  failed test
  s  skipped tests (reminder: use for dependency/platform mismatch only)
  x  xfailed test (test that was expected to fail)
  X  xpassed test (test that was expected to fail but passed)

  You can use any combination of 'fsxX' with the '-r' extended
  reporting option. The xfail/xpass results will show up as
  skipped tests in the junitxml output - which also fixes
  issue99.

- make py.test.cmdline.main() return the exitstatus instead of raising
  SystemExit and also allow it to be called multiple times.  This of
  course requires that your application and tests are properly teared
  down and don't have global state.

Fixes / Maintenance
++++++++++++++++++++++

- improved traceback presentation:
  - improved and unified reporting for "--tb=short" option
  - Errors during test module imports are much shorter, (using --tb=short style)
  - raises shows shorter more relevant tracebacks
  - --fulltrace now more systematically makes traces longer / inhibits cutting

- improve support for raises and other dynamically compiled code by
  manipulating python's linecache.cache instead of the previous
  rather hacky way of creating custom code objects.  This makes
  it seemlessly work on Jython and PyPy where it previously didn't.

- fix issue96: make capturing more resilient against Control-C
  interruptions (involved somewhat substantial refactoring
  to the underlying capturing functionality to avoid race
  conditions).

- fix chaining of conditional skipif/xfail decorators - so it works now
  as expected to use multiple @py.test.mark.skipif(condition) decorators,
  including specific reporting which of the conditions lead to skipping.

- fix issue95: late-import zlib so that it's not required
  for general py.test startup.

- fix issue94: make reporting more robust against bogus source code
  (and internally be more careful when presenting unexpected byte sequences)


Changes between 1.2.1 and 1.3.0
---------------------------------------------

- deprecate --report option in favour of a new shorter and easier to
  remember -r option: it takes a string argument consisting of any
  combination of 'xfsX' characters.  They relate to the single chars
  you see during the dotted progress printing and will print an extra line
  per test at the end of the test run.  This extra line indicates the exact
  position or test ID that you directly paste to the py.test cmdline in order
  to re-run a particular test.

- allow external plugins to register new hooks via the new
  pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager) hook.  The new release of
  the pytest-xdist plugin for distributed and looponfailing
  testing requires this feature.

- add a new pytest_ignore_collect(path, config) hook to allow projects and
  plugins to define exclusion behaviour for their directory structure -
  for example you may define in a conftest.py this method::

        def pytest_ignore_collect(path):
            return path.check(link=1)

  to prevent even a collection try of any tests in symlinked dirs.

- new pytest_pycollect_makemodule(path, parent) hook for
  allowing customization of the Module collection object for a
  matching test module.

- extend and refine xfail mechanism:
  ``@py.test.mark.xfail(run=False)`` do not run the decorated test
  ``@py.test.mark.xfail(reason="...")`` prints the reason string in xfail summaries
  specifiying ``--runxfail`` on command line virtually ignores xfail markers

- expose (previously internal) commonly useful methods:
  py.io.get_terminal_with() -> return terminal width
  py.io.ansi_print(...) -> print colored/bold text on linux/win32
  py.io.saferepr(obj) -> return limited representation string

- expose test outcome related exceptions as py.test.skip.Exception,
  py.test.raises.Exception etc., useful mostly for plugins
  doing special outcome interpretation/tweaking

- (issue85) fix junitxml plugin to handle tests with non-ascii output

- fix/refine python3 compatibility (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

- fixes for making the jython/win32 combination work, note however:
  jython2.5.1/win32 does not provide a command line launcher, see
  http://bugs.jython.org/issue1491 . See pylib install documentation
  for how to work around.

- fixes for handling of unicode exception values and unprintable objects

- (issue87) fix unboundlocal error in assertionold code

- (issue86) improve documentation for looponfailing

- refine IO capturing: stdin-redirect pseudo-file now has a NOP close() method

- ship distribute_setup.py version 0.6.10

- added links to the new capturelog and coverage plugins


Changes between 1.2.1 and 1.2.0
---------------------------------------------

- refined usage and options for "py.cleanup"::

    py.cleanup     # remove "*.pyc" and "*$py.class" (jython) files
    py.cleanup -e .swp -e .cache # also remove files with these extensions
    py.cleanup -s  # remove "build" and "dist" directory next to setup.py files
    py.cleanup -d  # also remove empty directories
    py.cleanup -a  # synonym for "-s -d -e 'pip-log.txt'"
    py.cleanup -n  # dry run, only show what would be removed

- add a new option "py.test --funcargs" which shows available funcargs
  and their help strings (docstrings on their respective factory function)
  for a given test path

- display a short and concise traceback if a funcarg lookup fails

- early-load "conftest.py" files in non-dot first-level sub directories.
  allows to conveniently keep and access test-related options in a ``test``
  subdir and still add command line options.

- fix issue67: new super-short traceback-printing option: "--tb=line" will print a single line for each failing (python) test indicating its filename, lineno and the failure value

- fix issue78: always call python-level teardown functions even if the
  according setup failed.  This includes refinements for calling setup_module/class functions
  which will now only be called once instead of the previous behaviour where they'd be called
  multiple times if they raise an exception (including a Skipped exception).  Any exception
  will be re-corded and associated with all tests in the according module/class scope.

- fix issue63: assume <40 columns to be a bogus terminal width, default to 80

- fix pdb debugging to be in the correct frame on raises-related errors

- update apipkg.py to fix an issue where recursive imports might
  unnecessarily break importing

- fix plugin links

Changes between 1.2 and 1.1.1
---------------------------------------------

- moved dist/looponfailing from py.test core into a new
  separately released pytest-xdist plugin.

- new junitxml plugin: --junitxml=path will generate a junit style xml file
  which is processable e.g. by the Hudson CI system.

- new option: --genscript=path will generate a standalone py.test script
  which will not need any libraries installed.  thanks to Ralf Schmitt.

- new option: --ignore will prevent specified path from collection.
  Can be specified multiple times.

- new option: --confcutdir=dir will make py.test only consider conftest
  files that are relative to the specified dir.

- new funcarg: "pytestconfig" is the pytest config object for access
  to command line args and can now be easily used in a test.

- install 'py.test' and `py.which` with a ``-$VERSION`` suffix to
  disambiguate between Python3, python2.X, Jython and PyPy installed versions.

- new "pytestconfig" funcarg allows access to test config object

- new "pytest_report_header" hook can return additional lines
  to be displayed at the header of a test run.

- (experimental) allow "py.test path::name1::name2::..." for pointing
  to a test within a test collection directly.  This might eventually
  evolve as a full substitute to "-k" specifications.

- streamlined plugin loading: order is now as documented in
  customize.html: setuptools, ENV, commandline, conftest.
  also setuptools entry point names are turned to canonical namees ("pytest_*")

- automatically skip tests that need 'capfd' but have no os.dup

- allow pytest_generate_tests to be defined in classes as well

- deprecate usage of 'disabled' attribute in favour of pytestmark
- deprecate definition of Directory, Module, Class and Function nodes
  in conftest.py files.  Use pytest collect hooks instead.

- collection/item node specific runtest/collect hooks are only called exactly
  on matching conftest.py files, i.e. ones which are exactly below
  the filesystem path of an item

- change: the first pytest_collect_directory hook to return something
  will now prevent further hooks to be called.

- change: figleaf plugin now requires --figleaf to run.  Also
  change its long command line options to be a bit shorter (see py.test -h).

- change: pytest doctest plugin is now enabled by default and has a
  new option --doctest-glob to set a pattern for file matches.

- change: remove internal py._* helper vars, only keep py._pydir

- robustify capturing to survive if custom pytest_runtest_setup
  code failed and prevented the capturing setup code from running.

- make py.test.* helpers provided by default plugins visible early -
  works transparently both for pydoc and for interactive sessions
  which will regularly see e.g. py.test.mark and py.test.importorskip.

- simplify internal plugin manager machinery
- simplify internal collection tree by introducing a RootCollector node

- fix assert reinterpreation that sees a call containing "keyword=..."

- fix issue66: invoke pytest_sessionstart and pytest_sessionfinish
  hooks on slaves during dist-testing, report module/session teardown
  hooks correctly.

- fix issue65: properly handle dist-testing if no
  execnet/py lib installed remotely.

- skip some install-tests if no execnet is available

- fix docs, fix internal bin/ script generation


Changes between 1.1.1 and 1.1.0
---------------------------------------------

- introduce automatic plugin registration via 'pytest11'
  entrypoints via setuptools' pkg_resources.iter_entry_points

- fix py.test dist-testing to work with execnet >= 1.0.0b4

- re-introduce py.test.cmdline.main() for better backward compatibility

- svn paths: fix a bug with path.check(versioned=True) for svn paths,
  allow '%' in svn paths, make svnwc.update() default to interactive mode
  like in 1.0.x and add svnwc.update(interactive=False) to inhibit interaction.

- refine distributed tarball to contain test and no pyc files

- try harder to have deprecation warnings for py.compat.* accesses
  report a correct location

Changes between 1.1.0 and 1.0.2
---------------------------------------------

* adjust and improve docs

* remove py.rest tool and internal namespace - it was
  never really advertised and can still be used with
  the old release if needed.  If there is interest
  it could be revived into its own tool i guess.

* fix issue48 and issue59: raise an Error if the module
  from an imported test file does not seem to come from
  the filepath - avoids "same-name" confusion that has
  been reported repeatedly

* merged Ronny's nose-compatibility hacks: now
  nose-style setup_module() and setup() functions are
  supported

* introduce generalized py.test.mark function marking

* reshuffle / refine command line grouping

* deprecate parser.addgroup in favour of getgroup which creates option group

* add --report command line option that allows to control showing of skipped/xfailed sections

* generalized skipping: a new way to mark python functions with skipif or xfail
  at function, class and modules level based on platform or sys-module attributes.

* extend py.test.mark decorator to allow for positional args

* introduce and test "py.cleanup -d" to remove empty directories

* fix issue #59 - robustify unittest test collection

* make bpython/help interaction work by adding an __all__ attribute
  to ApiModule, cleanup initpkg

* use MIT license for pylib, add some contributors

* remove py.execnet code and substitute all usages with 'execnet' proper

* fix issue50 - cached_setup now caches more to expectations
  for test functions with multiple arguments.

* merge Jarko's fixes, issue #45 and #46

* add the ability to specify a path for py.lookup to search in

* fix a funcarg cached_setup bug probably only occuring
  in distributed testing and "module" scope with teardown.

* many fixes and changes for making the code base python3 compatible,
  many thanks to Benjamin Peterson for helping with this.

* consolidate builtins implementation to be compatible with >=2.3,
  add helpers to ease keeping 2 and 3k compatible code

* deprecate py.compat.doctest|subprocess|textwrap|optparse

* deprecate py.magic.autopath, remove py/magic directory

* move pytest assertion handling to py/code and a pytest_assertion
  plugin, add "--no-assert" option, deprecate py.magic namespaces
  in favour of (less) py.code ones.

* consolidate and cleanup py/code classes and files

* cleanup py/misc, move tests to bin-for-dist

* introduce delattr/delitem/delenv methods to py.test's monkeypatch funcarg

* consolidate py.log implementation, remove old approach.

* introduce py.io.TextIO and py.io.BytesIO for distinguishing between
  text/unicode and byte-streams (uses underlying standard lib io.*
  if available)

* make py.unittest_convert helper script available which converts "unittest.py"
  style files into the simpler assert/direct-test-classes py.test/nosetests
  style.  The script was written by Laura Creighton.

* simplified internal localpath implementation

Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2
-------------------------------------------

* fixing packaging issues, triggered by fedora redhat packaging,
  also added doc, examples and contrib dirs to the tarball.

* added a documentation link to the new django plugin.

Changes between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------

* added a 'pytest_nose' plugin which handles nose.SkipTest,
  nose-style function/method/generator setup/teardown and
  tries to report functions correctly.

* capturing of unicode writes or encoded strings to sys.stdout/err
  work better, also terminalwriting was adapted and somewhat
  unified between windows and linux.

* improved documentation layout and content a lot

* added a "--help-config" option to show conftest.py / ENV-var names for
  all longopt cmdline options, and some special conftest.py variables.
  renamed 'conf_capture' conftest setting to 'option_capture' accordingly.

* fix issue #27: better reporting on non-collectable items given on commandline
  (e.g. pyc files)

* fix issue #33: added --version flag (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

* fix issue #32: adding support for "incomplete" paths to wcpath.status()

* "Test" prefixed classes are *not* collected by default anymore if they
  have an __init__ method

* monkeypatch setenv() now accepts a "prepend" parameter

Changes between 1.0.0b8 and 1.0.0b9
-------------------------------------------

* cleanly handle and report final teardown of test setup

* fix svn-1.6 compat issue with py.path.svnwc().versioned()
  (thanks Wouter Vanden Hove)

* setup/teardown or collection problems now show as ERRORs
  or with big "E"'s in the progress lines.  they are reported
  and counted separately.

* dist-testing: properly handle test items that get locally
  collected but cannot be collected on the remote side - often
  due to platform/dependency reasons

* simplified py.test.mark API - see keyword plugin documentation

* integrate better with logging: capturing now by default captures
  test functions and their immediate setup/teardown in a single stream

* capsys and capfd funcargs now have a readouterr() and a close() method
  (underlyingly py.io.StdCapture/FD objects are used which grew a
  readouterr() method as well to return snapshots of captured out/err)

* make assert-reinterpretation work better with comparisons not
  returning bools (reported with numpy from thanks maciej fijalkowski)

* reworked per-test output capturing into the pytest_iocapture.py plugin
  and thus removed capturing code from config object

* item.repr_failure(excinfo) instead of item.repr_failure(excinfo, outerr)


Changes between 1.0.0b7 and 1.0.0b8
-------------------------------------------

* pytest_unittest-plugin is now enabled by default

* introduced pytest_keyboardinterrupt hook and
  refined pytest_sessionfinish hooked, added tests.

* workaround a buggy logging module interaction ("closing already closed
  files").  Thanks to Sridhar Ratnakumar for triggering.

* if plugins use "py.test.importorskip" for importing
  a dependency only a warning will be issued instead
  of exiting the testing process.

* many improvements to docs:
  - refined funcargs doc , use the term "factory" instead of "provider"
  - added a new talk/tutorial doc page
  - better download page
  - better plugin docstrings
  - added new plugins page and automatic doc generation script

* fixed teardown problem related to partially failing funcarg setups
  (thanks MrTopf for reporting), "pytest_runtest_teardown" is now
  always invoked even if the "pytest_runtest_setup" failed.

* tweaked doctest output for docstrings in py modules,
  thanks Radomir.

Changes between 1.0.0b3 and 1.0.0b7
-------------------------------------------

* renamed py.test.xfail back to py.test.mark.xfail to avoid
  two ways to decorate for xfail

* re-added py.test.mark decorator for setting keywords on functions
  (it was actually documented so removing it was not nice)

* remove scope-argument from request.addfinalizer() because
  request.cached_setup has the scope arg. TOOWTDI.

* perform setup finalization before reporting failures

* apply modified patches from Andreas Kloeckner to allow
  test functions to have no func_code (#22) and to make
  "-k" and function keywords work  (#20)

* apply patch from Daniel Peolzleithner (issue #23)

* resolve issue #18, multiprocessing.Manager() and
  redirection clash

* make __name__ == "__channelexec__" for remote_exec code

Changes between 1.0.0b1 and 1.0.0b3
-------------------------------------------

* plugin classes are removed: one now defines
  hooks directly in conftest.py or global pytest_*.py
  files.

* added new pytest_namespace(config) hook that allows
  to inject helpers directly to the py.test.* namespace.

* documented and refined many hooks

* added new style of generative tests via
  pytest_generate_tests hook that integrates
  well with function arguments.


Changes between 0.9.2 and 1.0.0b1
-------------------------------------------

* introduced new "funcarg" setup method,
  see doc/test/funcarg.txt

* introduced plugin architecuture and many
  new py.test plugins, see
  doc/test/plugins.txt

* teardown_method is now guaranteed to get
  called after a test method has run.

* new method: py.test.importorskip(mod,minversion)
  will either import or call py.test.skip()

* completely revised internal py.test architecture

* new py.process.ForkedFunc object allowing to
  fork execution of a function to a sub process
  and getting a result back.

XXX lots of things missing here XXX

Changes between 0.9.1 and 0.9.2
-------------------------------------------

* refined installation and metadata, created new setup.py,
  now based on setuptools/ez_setup (thanks to Ralf Schmitt
  for his support).

* improved the way of making py.* scripts available in
  windows environments, they are now added to the
  Scripts directory as ".cmd" files.

* py.path.svnwc.status() now is more complete and
  uses xml output from the 'svn' command if available
  (Guido Wesdorp)

* fix for py.path.svn* to work with svn 1.5
  (Chris Lamb)

* fix path.relto(otherpath) method on windows to
  use normcase for checking if a path is relative.

* py.test's traceback is better parseable from editors
  (follows the filenames:LINENO: MSG convention)
  (thanks to Osmo Salomaa)

* fix to javascript-generation, "py.test --runbrowser"
  should work more reliably now

* removed previously accidentally added
  py.test.broken and py.test.notimplemented helpers.

* there now is a py.__version__ attribute
