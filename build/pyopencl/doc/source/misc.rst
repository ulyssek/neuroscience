Syntax highlighting
-------------------

You can obtain Vim syntax highlighting for OpenCL C inlined in Python by
checking `this file
<https://github.com/inducer/pyopencl/blob/master/contrib/pyopencl.vim>`_.

Note that the triple-quoted strings containing the source must start with
`"""//CL// ..."""`.

Guidelines
==========

.. _api-compatibility:

API Stability
-------------

I consider PyOpenCL's API "stable".  That doesn't mean it can't
change. But if it does, your code will generally continue to run. It
may however start spewing warnings about things you need to change to
stay compatible with future versions.

Deprecation warnings will be around for a whole year, as identified by the
first number in the release name.  (the "2014" in "2014.1") I.e. a function
that was deprecated in 2014.n will generally be removed in 2015.n (or perhaps
later). Further, the stability promise applies for any code that's part of a
released version. It doesn't apply to undocumented bits of the API, and it
doesn't apply to unreleased code downloaded from git.

.. _versus-c:

Relation with OpenCL's C Bindings
---------------------------------

We've tried to follow these guidelines when binding the OpenCL's
C interface to Python:

* Remove the `cl_`, `CL_` and `cl` prefix from data types, macros and
  function names.
* Follow :pep:`8`, i.e.

  * Make function names lowercase.
  * If a data type or function name is composed of more than one word,
    separate the words with a single underscore.

* `get_info` functions become attributes.
* Object creation is done by constructors, to the extent possible.
  (i.e. minimize use of "factory functions")

* If an operation involves two or more "complex" objects (like e.g. a
  kernel enqueue involves a kernel and a queue), refuse the temptation
  to guess which one should get a method for the operation.
  Instead, simply leave that command to be a function.

User-visible Changes
====================

Version 2013.1
--------------
.. note::

    This version is currently under development. You can get snapshots from
    PyOpenCL's `git repository <https://github.com/inducer/pyopencl>`_

* Vastly improved :ref:`custom-scan`.
* Add :func:`pyopencl.tools.match_dtype_to_c_struct`,
  for better integration of the CL and :mod:`numpy` type systems.
* More/improved Bessel functions.
  See `the source <https://github.com/inducer/pyopencl/tree/master/src/cl>`_.
* Add :envvar:`PYOPENCL_NO_CACHE` environment variable to aid debugging
  (e.g. with AMD's CPU implementation, see
  `their programming guide <http://developer.amd.com/sdks/AMDAPPSDK/assets/AMD_Accelerated_Parallel_Processing_OpenCL_Programming_Guide.pdf>`_.
* Deprecated :func:`pyopencl.tools.register_dtype` in favor of
  :func:`pyopencl.tools.get_or_register_dtype`.
* Clean up the :class:`pyopencl.array.Array` constructor interface. Deprecate
  arrays with :attr:`pyopencl.array.Array.queue` equal to *None*.
* Deprecate :class:`pyopencl.array.DefaultAllocator`.
* Deprecate :class:`pyopencl.tools.CLAllocator`.
* Introudce :class:`pyopencl.tools.DeferredAllocator`, :class:`pyopencl.tools.ImmediateAllocator`.
* Allow arrays whose beginning does not coincide with the beginning of their
  :attr:`pyopencl.array.Array.data` :class:`pyopencl.Buffer`.
  See :attr:`pyopencl.array.Array.base_data` and :attr:`pyopencl.array.Array.offset`.
  Note that not all functions in PyOpenCL support such arrays just yet. These
  will fail with :exc:`pyopencl.array.ArrayHasOffsetError`.
* Add :meth:`pyopencl.array.Array.__getitem__` and :meth:`pyopencl.array.Array.__setitem__`,
  supporting generic slicing.

  It is *possible* to create non-contiguous arrays using this functionality.
  Most operations (elementwise etc.) will not work on such arrays.

  Note also that some operations (specifically, reductions and scans) on sliced
  arrays that start past the beginning of the original array will fail for now.
  This will be fixed in a future release.

* :class:`pyopencl.CommandQueue` may be used as a context manager (in a ``with`` statement)
* Add :func:`pyopencl.clmath.atan2`, :func:`pyopencl.clmath.atan2pi`.
* Add :func:`pyopencl.array.concatenate`.
* Add :meth:`pyopencl.Kernel.capture_call`.

.. note::

    The addition of :meth:`pyopencl.array.Array.__getitem__` has an unintended
    consequence due to `numpy bug 3375
    <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/3375>`_.  For instance, this
    expression::

        numpy.float32(5) * some_pyopencl_array

    may take a very long time to execute. This is because :mod:`numpy` first
    builds an object array of (compute-device) scalars (!) before it decided that
    that's probably not such a bright idea and finally calls
    :meth:`pyopencl.array.Array.__rmul__`.

    Note that only left arithmetic operations of :class:`pyopencl.array.Array`
    by :mod:`numpy` scalars are affected. Python's number types (:class:`float` etc.)
    are unaffected, as are right multiplications.

    If a program that used to run fast suddenly runs extremely slowly, it is
    likely that this bug is to blame.

    Here's what you can do:

    * Use Python scalars instead of :mod:`numpy` scalars.
    * Switch to right multiplications if possible.
    * Use a patched :mod:`numpy`. See the bug report linked above for a pull
      request with a fix.
    * Switch to a fixed version of :mod:`numpy` when available.

Version 2012.1
--------------

* Support for complex numbers.
* Support for Bessel functions. (experimental)
* Numerous fixes.

Version 2011.2
--------------

* Add :func:`pyopencl.enqueue_migrate_mem_object`.
* Add :func:`pyopencl.image_from_array`.
* IMPORTANT BUGFIX: Kernel caching was broken for all the 2011.1.x releases, with
  severe consequences on the execution time of :class:`pyopencl.array.Array`
  operations.
  Henrik Andresen at a `PyOpenCL workshop at DTU <http://gpulab.imm.dtu.dk/courses.html>`_
  first noticed the strange timings.
* All comparable PyOpenCL objects are now also hashable.
* Add :func:`pyopencl.tools.context_dependent_memoize` to the documented
  functionality.
* Base :mod:`pyopencl.clrandom` on `RANLUXCL <https://bitbucket.org/ivarun/ranluxcl>`_,
  add functionality.
* Add :class:`pyopencl.NannyEvent` objects.
* Add :mod:`pyopencl.characterize`.
* Ensure compatibility with OS X Lion.
* Add :func:`pyopencl.tools.register_dtype` to enable scan/reduction on struct types.
* :func:`pyopencl.enqueue_migrate_mem_object` was renamed
  :func:`pyopencl.enqueue_migrate_mem_object_ext`.
  :func:`pyopencl.enqueue_migrate_mem_object` now refers to the OpenCL 1.2 function
  of this name, if available.
* :func:`pyopencl.create_sub_devices` was renamed
  :func:`pyopencl.create_sub_devices_ext`.
  :func:`pyopencl.create_sub_devices` now refers to the OpenCL 1.2 function
  of this name, if available.
* Alpha support for OpenCL 1.2.

Version 0.91.2
--------------

* :meth:`pyopencl.Program.build` now captures build logs and adds them
